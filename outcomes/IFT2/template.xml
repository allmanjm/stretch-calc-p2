    <intro>
    <p>Compute each of the following. 
    Set up an appropriate definite integral, and write it down explicitly. 
    If you need to use the power rule to compute an antiderivative, say so, 
    and make your use of the power rule obvious. 
    Further, if you need to perform a substitution to compute an antiderivative,
    write down your choice of substitution explicitly, 
    and explain/show how your substitution leads to a correct answer.</p>
