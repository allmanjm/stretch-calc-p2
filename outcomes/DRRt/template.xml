                    Suppose a ladder of length <m>{{ladderlength}}</m> ft is leaning against a wall.  Then the base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of <m>{{velocityx}}</m> feet/second.  What is the velocity of the top of the ladder when the base of the ladder is <m>{{distancex}}</m> feet away from the wall?

                    Suppose an oil spill in the ocean formed a circle and was growing at a rate of <m>{{dadt}}</m> feet<m>^2/</m>minute.  When the oil slick reaches a radius of <m>{{radius}}</m>, how fast is the radius of the oil spill growing?

                    Suppose a person who was <m> {{heightperson}} </m> feet tall 
                    was standing between a light on the ground and a wall.

                    If they start walking torwards the {{persondirection}} 
                    at a speed of <m>{{personspeed}}</m> feet/second, 
                    how fast would the height of the shadow they cast be changing 
                    (at the initial instant they begin walking)
                    and in what direction?

                    Suppose that a television camera is filming a rocket and that 
                    the camera is located on the ground <m> {{X}} </m> miles from the launchpad.
                    The camera must remain locked onto the rocket in the center of its shot, and therefore,
                    the angle of elevation for the camera's line-of-sight must increase as the rocket travels. 
                    If the speed of the rocket is <m> {{dhdt}} </m> miles per second, 
                    how fast is the angle of elevation for the camera's line-of-sight increasing 
                    when the rocket's height is <m> {{h}} </m> miles. 
                    Give your answer in degrees per second and round to 3 decimal places.
