                Suppose a factory intends to manufacture cardboard crates.
                The crates will be in the shape of a rectangular prism{{topQ}} 
                Due to constraints in the infrastructure of the factory, 
                the height of the crate must equal the length of one of the sides of the base.
                Further, they must use <m>{{A}}</m> square inches of material for each crate.
                Given these contraints, what is the maximum volume for such a crate?
                </p>
                <p>
                    **note** This solves the problem: "given a limit on our material, 
                    how do we maximize our carrying capacity?"

                    Suppose a factory intends to manufacture sheet metal crates.
                    The crates will be in the shape of a rectangular prism{{topQ}}
                    Due to constraints imposed by their client, the length of the base of a 
                    crate must be <m>{{c}}</m> times the width of the base. Further, the 
                    volume of a crate must be <m>{{V0}}</m> feet<m>^3</m>.
                    Given these constraints, what is the minimum surface area of such a crate?
                </p>
                <p>
                    **note** This solves the problem: "given that we must carry (at least)
                    a certain level of capacity, how do we minimize our material used 
                    (or equivalently, our cost)?"
