        <p> Consider the function
<m mode = "display"> f(x) = {{f}}.</m>

For reference, the first and second derivatives for <m>f(x)</m> are given by
the formulas below (you do not need to re-compute these).
<m mode = "display"> f'(x) = {{df}} \quad f''(x) = {{ddf}}</m>

Your task is to sketch a graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> in which you incorporate

            <item><p>where the graph of <m>f(x)</m> is
            positive/negative, increasing/decreasing, and concave up/down;</p></item>

Warning: Labels on tick marks on auto-generated sign charts are 
rounded to three significant digits (or are integers). Furthermore, 
on all auto-generated sign charts, <m>x=0</m> appears as an 
unlabeled tickmark. This is an artifact of the automatically 
generating computer code, and happens whether or not <m>x=0</m> is, 
in fact, a "special point" for that sign chart.
