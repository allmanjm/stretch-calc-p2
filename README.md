# Stretch Calculus: Part 2

This is a bank of randomized exercises for the CheckIt platform. The exercises align with 15 learning outcomes for single-variable calculus. 

The exercises were developed originally for the second semester of a year-long "Calculus I with Integrated Precalculus" sequence at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC [<https://math.wfu.edu/>]. In particular, this bank is intended to pair with the precalculus skills bank PreCalcSkills2 which can be found at <https://allmanjm.github.io/pre-calc-2/>. At the end of this document, there is a list of how the PreCalcSkills2 outcomes align with the outcomes in this bank.

## Learning Outcomes for Stretch Calculus: Part 2

### L. Limits

###### LSTr. Limits of special transcendental functions.

I can compute limits of special transcendental functions.

###### LLH. Limits with L'Hôpital's Rule.

I can compute limits using L'Hôpital's Rule when the initial form is indeterminate of type 0/0 or ∞/∞.

###### LSy. Limits: Synthesis.

I can compute single-variable limits.

### D. Differentiation

###### DDfn2. The definition of derivative.

I can use the definition of the derivative as a limit and knowledge of special transcendental functions to compute derivatives of sin(x) and cos(x).

###### DTrg. Derivatives of trigonometric functions.

I can use the quotient rule and knowledge of sin(x) and cos(x) to compute derivatives of sec(x), csc(x), tan(x), and cot(x).

###### DImp. Implicit derivatives.

I can compute implicit derivatives.

###### DIAR2. Identify and apply derivative rules.

I can identify which differentiation rule(s) need to be applied (in order); moreover, I can apply the rules to compute the derivative.

###### DRR. Related rates.

I can solve related rates problems.

###### DSC1.1 First derivatives and sign charts.

I can make a *sign chart* for the first derivative and use it to (1) find where a function is increasing/decreasing, and (2) classify *critical points*. In other words, I can perform a **first derivative test**.

###### DSC2.1 Second derivatives and sign charts.

I can make a *sign chart* for the second derivative and use it to (1) find where a function is concave up/down, and (2) locate points of inflection.

###### DOpt. Optimization.

I can solve optimization problems using knowledge of differentiation.

### I. Integration

###### IIP. Basic indefinite integrals: power rule and special functions.

I can compute antiderivatives (aka general indefinite integrals) for linear combinations of power functions and functions which I recognize as a derivative of a special function.

###### IIS. Indefinite integrals via substitution.

I can compute indefinite integrals with the substitution method.

###### IPh. Integration and motion.

I can solve physics problems involving motion of objects along a straight line.

###### IFTC. Definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

I can compute definite integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
