# Stretch Calculus: Part 2

This is a bank of randomized exercises for the CheckIt platform. The exercises align with 14 learning outcomes for single-variable calculus. 

The exercises were developed originally for the second semester of a year-long "Calculus I with Integrated Precalculus" sequence at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC [<https://math.wfu.edu/>]. In particular, this bank is intended to pair with the precalculus skills bank PreCalcSkills2 which can be found at <https://allmanjm.github.io/pre-calc-2/>.

## Learning Outcomes for Stretch Calculus: Part 2

### L. Limits

###### LLHR. Limits with L'Hôpital's Rule.

I can compute limits using L'Hôpital's Rule when the initial form is indeterminate of type 0/0 or ∞/∞.

###### LAll Limits: Synthesis.

I can compute single-variable limits.

### D. Differentiation

###### Ddfn. The definition of derivative.

I can use the definition of the derivative as a limit and knowledge of special transcendental functions to compute derivatives of common transcendental functions.

###### DTrg. Derivatives of trigonometric functions.

I can use the quotient rule and knowledge of sin(x) and cos(x) to compute derivatives of sec(x), csc(x), tan(x), and cot(x).

###### DImp. Implicit derivatives.

I can compute and interpret implicit derivatives.

###### DAll. Identify and apply derivative rules.

I can identify which differentiation rule(s) need to be applied (in order); moreover, I can apply the rules to compute the derivative.

###### DRRt. Related rates.

I can solve related rates problems.

###### DSCt. First derivatives and sign charts.

I can make a *sign chart* for the first derivative and use it to (1) find where a function is increasing/decreasing, and (2) classify *critical points*. In other words, I can perform a **first derivative test**.

###### DGrS. 

I can sketch accurate graphs of functions $y=f(x)$ by using (1) information from the three sign charts for $f$, $f’$, and $f’’$ together with (2) information about the two limits of $f$ as $x\to\pm\infty$.

### I. Integration

###### IPRS. Basic indefinite integrals: power rule and special functions.

I can compute antiderivatives (aka general indefinite integrals) for linear combinations of power functions and functions which I recognize as a derivative of a special function.

###### ISub. Indefinite integrals via substitution.

I can compute indefinite integrals with the substitution method.

###### IPhy. Integration and motion.

I can solve physics problems involving motion of objects along a straight line.

###### IFT1. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I.

I can compute derivatives of area functionals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

###### IFT2. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II.

I can compute definite integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

### CMC. Calculus Mastery Checkpoints

###### CMC1. Sketch a Rational Function

I can sketch the graph of a rational function f using knowledge of f, f', and f''.

###### CMC2. Perform the first derivative test

I can perform the first derivative test for local extrema on various types of functions.
